## About polytopes
Wikipedia page [Uniform 4-polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_4-polytope) includes nice explanation.  The name of polytopes in "**-cell series" in this app are based on Coxeter diagrams. 0 in this app corresponds to ● in the Coxeter diagram and 1 corresponds to ◉. Thus, for example, 0101 in this app corresponds to Coxeter diagram ●－◉－●－◉.  Snub is ◯－◯－◯－◯.
